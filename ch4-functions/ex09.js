// Line 2: product, left, right

// Line 3: product

// Line 6: getNumber, prompt

// Line 7: parseFloat, question, prompt. This one is a little tricky. parseFloat 
// is an actual built-in function in JavaScript; we are pretending that question 
// also is a built-in function. As such, we know that both parseFloat and 
// question are variable names.

// Line 12: console, left, right, multiply: console.log is a little tricky here.
//  console is the variable name for the built-in Console object. In contrast,
//   console.log is the name of a method in that object. As such, log is a 
//   property name, not a variable name.
