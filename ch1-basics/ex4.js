console.log('5' + 10); //Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15

// The code logs 510 since every + expression that has a string operand produces a
// string result no matter what the other operand is. In other words, the Number 
// 10 gets coerced to a String and then gets concatenated to the String '5', which produces '510'.
